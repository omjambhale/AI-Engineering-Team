# Design for a Trading Simulation Platform Account Management System

The module will be implemented in a single file named `accounts.py`. This file will contain a class `Account` and a test implementation of the `get_share_price(symbol)` function to return fixed prices for certain stocks.

## Class: Account

This class will encapsulate the user's account management functionalities including creating an account, depositing and withdrawing funds, recording share transactions, and generating reports.

### Attributes:
- `balance`: float - The current cash balance of the account.
- `initial_deposit`: float - The initial deposit made into the account.
- `holdings`: dict - A dictionary to track the number of shares held for each stock symbol.
- `transactions`: list - A list to store all the transactions made by the account.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Description: Initializes the account with an initial deposit.
- Parameters:
  - `initial_deposit`: float - The amount of initial deposit into the account.

#### `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Description: Increases the account's balance by the specified amount.
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: float - The amount to be deposited.

#### `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Description: Decreases the account's balance by the specified amount if it does not result in a negative balance.
- Parameters:
  - `amount`: float - The amount to be withdrawn.
- Returns: `True` if the withdrawal was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Description: Buys a specified quantity of shares of a given stock if there are enough funds.
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: str - The stock symbol.
  - `quantity`: int - The number of shares to buy.
- Returns: `True` if the transaction was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Description: Sells a specified quantity of shares of a given stock if the shares are available in the account.
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: str - The stock symbol.
  - `quantity`: int - The number of shares to sell.
- Returns: `True` if the transaction was successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Description: Calculates the total portfolio value based on the current share prices and holdings.
- Returns: The total value of the portfolio.

#### `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
- Description: Calculates the profit or loss compared to the initial deposit.
- Returns: The account's current profit or loss.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
- Description: Returns the current holdings of the account.
- Returns: A dictionary with stock symbols as keys and the number of shares as values.

#### `get_transactions(self) -> list`
- Description: Lists all the transactions that have occurred in the account.
- Returns: A list of transactions.

### Helper Function:

#### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
- Description: Retrieves the current price of the specified stock symbol. Includes a test implementation with fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.
- Parameters:
  - `symbol`: str - The stock symbol for which the price is desired.
- Returns: The current price of the stock as a float.

### Test Implementation of `get_share_price`

For testing, the `get_share_price(symbol)` function will have the following fixed prices:
- AAPL: 150.0
- TSLA: 700.0
- GOOGL: 2800.0

This design ensures that we meet the requirements for a functional account management system within a trading simulation platform. The methods provided give a clear pathway for implementing the core functionalities required to manage cash, handle share transactions, and provide necessary reports.
